This is a simple NSFC LaTeX template. 
I made this template myself and hope it allows the researchers to write proposals with fun. 
Handling Chinese with LaTeX is somewhat messy and platform-dependent. 
I prepare two templates. One for Windows (works for Win 7/10), another for MAC OS (works for MAC OS 10.14).  

How to use:  
1) replace XXX with your stuffs 2) compile it using xelatex 

Warning: 
So far, there is no official LaTeX template for NSFC proposals, 
and this latex template is not guaranteed to be consistent with the latest Word template. 
Please double check the up-to-date official Word template and craft this latex template yourself.
